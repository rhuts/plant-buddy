## Practices to Keep
Writing out sprint deliverables on a whiteboard
and assigning those tasks collaboratively helped us to bring ownership to project components and split up work.
This approach worked well for us because we would all discuss our strengths and weaknesses and asses
who is most suited for each project component. At the end, we would take a picture of the tasks assignment
and make it available on our group chat.

## Practices to Add
Different team members looking over and testing each other's components before adding to the project would be beneficial
because we would be able to spot and correct any mistakes earlier than whilst testing.

## Practices to Purge
Although most important decisions were discussed during in person meetings where everyone was present,
some key decisions were made inside our group chat. Moving these few key decisions back into in person meetings would
be ideal because it is guaranteed that everyone will have a chance to observe and provide input at the same time.

## Best/Worst Experience
- A great experience that we had was connecting all of the components required for the Plant Buddy
system and observing the individual pieces function with cohesion as a whole.
- A bad experience that we had was working with Pivotal Tracker. We would prefer if Pivotal Tracker would allow
us to create completely custom sprint start and end times. We were not able to do so because explicitly modifying each
sprint was not allowed and the velocity setting would affect the duration and number of iterations we had.
