Date: Friday, March 2

Participants:

  - Dean Wedgbury
  - Daniel Wang
  - Roman Huts
  - Dominik Loncar

 ## Overview:

We discussed what we wanted to accomplish during this sprint, broke down those things into tasks, and assigned each member to them. We also talked about the future sprint, sprint3.

## User stories chosen for Sprint2:

We want to create a web application to display our data to the user.

In particular, we plan to implement the following user stories (from PB.md):

- As a visual person, I want to see a history of the plants data over time, so that I have a better understanding of my plant's progress. [1/21]
- As a researcher/beginner/hobbyist, I want to have a simple, intuitive, user friendly and visually appealing website so that I can look forward to checking on my plant every day. [3/21]

## Task breakdown:

We broke these user stories into 6 tasks:

- Login Page
- HomePage
- Resitration Page
- Page Navigation
- Aesthetics
- Connecting to the Database

More details on how we will accomplish these tasks:

- We will be using PHP (tentatively) to create the different pages.
- Aesthetics will be done in CSS in a separate style.css.
- We will be connecting to the database using php postgres functions.


## Goals for sprint3:

- Display graphs of our data using a processing library for javascript. More details will be discussed in sprint3.
