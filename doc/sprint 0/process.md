## Organization
- We have chosen to organize tasks and roles by interest and skills. This decision was made by consensus during an in person meeting.
An example of the role assignment is: members who have experience working with Arduinos will initially begin by focusing on the Arduino
programming component.
- Sprint 0 tasks were written on a whiteboard during a meeting and had been split up and assigned to members. A picture of the whiteboard
had been sent to the team group chat for record keeping. Tasks were assigned to suit each team member's strengths and a deadline was set
for Monday **January 29, 2018**. 

## Decision Making
- All key decisions were made democratically. When individuals brought up decisions, each person contributed their solution and the outcome
was decided once everyone had voiced their opinions and agreed.

## User Story Priority/Points
- Our proiorities will use the following scale: 1, 2, 3, ... , 10. The 1-10 scale was chosen for the simplicity of comparing priorities.
- Our story points will use the fibonacci scale (skipping the first number): 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.
The fibonacci scale was chosen because it reflects the uncertainty of estimating larger user stories.
- We have decided to conduct two rounds of voting for story point esitmates. The
first vote will be for the purpose of gaining an idea of how everyone feels about the difficulty
of each user story. Outlying opinions will be quickly voiced to either nudge everyone else's
estimates closer to theirs or vice versa. The second round of voting will solidify the estimates
as we will take the mean of the votes (rounded to the nearest on the fibonacci scale) for the user story points.

## Meetings
- Meetings were primarily in person, within study rooms. Those that could not attend would communicate through Facebook messenger. Meetings were also held
inside a group chat within Facebook messenger where less important decisions were made.
- Weekly meetings occured on Wednesday mornings, in addition to two key decision making meetings.

## Lessons
- Creating meeting goals for future meetings will help keep the team focused and better map out progress.
