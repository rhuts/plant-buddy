## Practices to Keep
Working on the website as a group is more efficient than assigning tasks and expecting everyone to understand what the other parts of the website will do. Lots of work is dependent on other work so communication is crucial and having one instance of the website running is better than each of us having our own instance of the website.

## Practices to Add
Setting up expectations for what a part of the website will do would make it easier for us to understand what we're aiming at instead of just assuming that we all have the same implementation in mind.

## Practices to Purge
Working in big chunks of time as opposed to spreading work out certainly made us work less effectively, but this was inevitable due to all of the midterms that happened during this sprint. Ideally we would work at the same time in the same place but this is hard to coordinate with 6 group members all with different schedules and responsibilities. 

## Best/Worst Experience
- Seeing all of the components work together and our website running in a stable manner was a very inspiring moment.
- Pivot tracker is still feels like more of a chore than a tool meant to help us.
